# vis.gl Charter

## Section 0: Guiding Principles

The `vis.gl` project is part of the [OpenJS Foundation][https://openjsf.org], which operates transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

All collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. The community must not exclude any participant based on criteria other than those applied consistently and reasonably to all collaborators.

## Section 1: Scope

`vis.gl` is to provide a comprehensive, open-source solution for GPU-powered visualizations of large-scale datasets, in particular geospatial data visualizations. The `vis.gl` project consists of many different sub-projects, such as a layer-based visualization framework, GPU toolkit, basemap react components, and more. The project is designed to be modular, so that it can be used in a variety of different environments and for different purposes.

The scope of project includes documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

### 1.1: In-scope

 - Overseeing the **technical development** of the core vis.gl libraries and all affiliated sub-projects.
 - **Release planning** and coordination
 - Managing project repositories and **governance**, including issue tracking, pull request processes, and repository organization.
 - Defining and enforcing **coding standards, testing practices, and development processes** to maintain code quality.
 - Maintaining the list of **Maintainers and core contributors**, and setting permissions in project repositories.
 - Reviewing and proposing **new project incubations or sub-projects**, as well as deciding on deprecations or significant changes to the project’s scope.
 - Formation of technical **working groups**.
 - **Representation** in technical collaborations with external communities.

## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.

Technical leadership for the projects within the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) (CPC). In the case of the `vis.gl` project, it is delegated to the [Steering Committee Members](https://github.com/visgl/tsc/blob/master/README.md#steering-committee-members) (the “TSC”). The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This `vis.gl` Charter reflects a carefully constructed balanced role for the TSC and the CPC in the governance of the OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the TSC to propose changes using simple majority of the full TSC, the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the CPC. The CPC may additionally make amendments to the project charter at any time, though the CPC will not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes, or meetings of the TSC.
