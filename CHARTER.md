# vis.gl Charter

## Section 0: Guiding Principles

The `vis.gl` project is part of the [OpenJS Foundation][https://openjsf.org], which operates transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

All collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. The community must not exclude any participant based on criteria other than those applied consistently and reasonably to all collaborators.

## Section 1: Scope

`vis.gl` is to provide a comprehensive, open-source solution for GPU-powered visualizations of large-scale datasets, in particular geospatial data visualizations.

The scope of project includes documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

### 1.1: In-scope

 - Overseeing the **technical development** of the core vis.gl libraries and all affiliated sub-projects.
 - **Release planning** and coordination
 - Managing project repositories and **governance**, including issue tracking, pull request processes, and repository organization.
 - Defining and enforcing **coding standards, testing practices, and development processes** to maintain code quality.
 - Maintaining the list of **Maintainers and core contributors**, and setting permissions in project repositories.
 - Reviewing and proposing **new project incubations or sub-projects**, as well as deciding on deprecations or significant changes to the project’s scope.
 - Formation of technical **working groups**.
 - **Representation** in technical collaborations with external communities.

## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.

Technical leadership for `vis.gl` is delegated by the OpenJS Cross-Project Council (CPC) through this charter. The `vis.gl` Technical Steering Committee (TSC) is responsible for all technical aspects of the vis.gl project and its sub-projects. The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The TSC operates independently on technical matters. This charter may be amended by the TSC (via a majority vote) subject to CPC approval. The CPC may also propose amendments, but does not interfere with day-to-day technical decisions.
