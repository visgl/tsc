# vis.gl Charter
Vis.gl aims to provide an open-source JavaScript framework for high-performance visualizations of large datasets on the web. It prioritizes strong support for geospatial data visualization, while also being flexible to cater to diverse non-geospatial visualization needs. It is designed to make advanced visualization techniques accessible to a wide range of developers by providing a user-friendly API and well-documented framework.
## Section 0: Guiding Principles

The `vis.gl` project is part of the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org), which operates transparently, openly, collaboratively, and ethically. Project proposals, timelines, and status must not merely be open, but also easily visible to outsiders.

All collaborators must allow open participation from any individual or organization meeting the requirements for contributing under this Charter and any policies adopted by the TSC, regardless of competitive interests. The community must not exclude any participant based on criteria other than those applied consistently and reasonably to all collaborators.

## Section 1: Scope

`vis.gl` is to provide a comprehensive, open-source solution for GPU-powered visualizations of large-scale datasets, in particular geospatial data visualizations. The `vis.gl` project consists of many different sub-projects, such as a layer-based visualization framework, GPU toolkit, basemap react components, and more. The project is designed to be modular, so that it can be used in a variety of different environments and for different purposes.

The scope of project includes documentation, testing, integration and the creation of other artifacts that aid the development, deployment, operation or adoption of the open source project.

### 1.1: In-scope

 - Overseeing the **technical development** of the core vis.gl libraries and all affiliated sub-projects.
 - **Release planning** and coordination
 - Managing project repositories and **governance**, including issue tracking, pull request processes, and repository organization.
 - Defining and enforcing **coding standards, testing practices, and development processes** to maintain code quality.
 - Maintaining the list of **Maintainers and core contributors**, and setting permissions in project repositories.
 - Reviewing and proposing **new project incubations or sub-projects**, as well as deciding on deprecations or significant changes to the project’s scope.
 - Formation of technical **working groups**.
 - **Representation** in technical collaborations with external communities.

## Section 2: Relationship with OpenJS Foundation CPC.

Technical leadership for the projects within the [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org/) is delegated to the projects through their project charters by the [OpenJS Foundation Cross-Project Council](https://openjsf.org/about/governance/) (CPC). In the case of the `vis.gl` project, it is delegated to the [Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/visgl/tsc/blob/master/README.md#steering-committee-members) (the “TSC”). The OpenJS Foundation's business leadership is the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

This `vis.gl` Charter reflects a carefully constructed balanced role for the TSC and the CPC in the governance of the OpenJS Foundation. The charter amendment process is for the TSC to propose changes using simple majority of the full TSC, the proposed changes being subject to review and approval by the CPC. The CPC may additionally make amendments to the project charter at any time, though the CPC will not interfere with day-to-day discussions, votes, or meetings of the TSC.

### Section 4.2: Decision-making, Voting, and/or Elections

The vis.gl Technical Steering Committee (TSC) operates on a consensus-seeking basis. Most decisions are expected to be resolved through open discussion and agreement. However, when consensus cannot be reached, any TSC member may call for a vote.

 - **Eligibility:** All steering committee members are voting members and may participate in any vote.

 - **Quorum:** A quorum is established when at least 50% of steering committee members members are present. The steering committee members may meet without quorum, but may not make binding decisions.

 - **Votes During Meetings:** When quorum is met, decisions require a simple majority of the steering committee members present.

 - **Electronic Votes:** Decisions made asynchronously (e.g., over email or GitHub) require a simple majority of all steering committee members.

 - **Escalation:** If a vote results in a tie or fails to resolve a dispute, any TSC member may refer the matter to the OpenJS Foundation Board for mediation or guidance.

### Section 4.3: Other Project Roles

## Section 5: Definitions

- *Steering committee member*: A core maintainer of the project, provides leadership and oversees feature and technical directions.
- *Maintainer*: Steering committee members delegate project responsibilities to maintainers, as documented in [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md).
