# flowmap.gl

This is a proposal to transfer flowmap.gl to vis.gl, an OpenJS Foundation project within the Open Visualization Collaboration Space (formerly the Urban Computing Foundation).

> Note: This proposal was originally accepted by the vis.gl Technical Steering Committee (TSC) on 2022-06-07 when the Urban Computing Foundation merged into the OpenJS Foundation.

## Project description

Flowmap.gl is a JavaScript library for flow map rendering implemented as a custom layer for deck.gl. It is used for visualizing commuting behavior, bus, subway and air travels, bicycle sharing, human and bird migration, refugee flows, freight transportation, marine traffic, trade and many other topics. The layer is rendered in WebGL and can handle relatively large numbers of flows with good performance.


## Statement on alignment with OpenJS Foundation charter's mission

Transferring to an open source foundation will bring in strong technical leadership to flowmap.gl and increase the appeal for high effort collaborations between itself and other vis.gl projects.

We’re also looking to expand the number of contributors and users coming from the growing vis.gl community.
